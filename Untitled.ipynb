       "u'Yahoo Inc. (styled as Yahoo!) is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Sunnyvale, California. It is globally known for its Web portal, search engine Yahoo! Search, and related services, including Yahoo! Directory, Yahoo! Mail, Yahoo! News, Yahoo! Finance, Yahoo! Groups, Yahoo! Answers, advertising, online mapping, video sharing, fantasy sports and its social media website. It is one of the most popular sites in the United States. According to third-party web analytics providers, Alexa and SimilarWeb, Yahoo! is the highest-read news and media website, with over 7 billion readers per month, being the fourth most visited website globally, as of June 2015. According to news sources, roughly 700 million people visit Yahoo websites every month. Yahoo itself claims it attracts \"more than half a billion consumers every month in more than 30 languages.\"\\nYahoo was founded by Jerry Yang and David Filo in January 1994 and was incorporated on March 2, 1995. Marissa Mayer, a former Google executive, serves as CEO and President of the company.\\nIn January 2015, the company announced it planned to spin-off its stake in Alibaba Group in a separately listed company. In December 2015 it reversed this decision, opting instead to spin-off its internet business as a separate company.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Founding ===\\n\\nIn January 1994, Yang and Filo were electrical engineering graduate students at Stanford University when they created a website named \"Jerry and David\\'s guide to the World Wide Web\". The site was a directory of other websites, organized in a hierarchy, as opposed to a searchable index of pages. In March 1994, \"Jerry and David\\'s Guide to the World Wide Web\" was renamed \"Yahoo!\" The \"yahoo.com\" domain was created on January 18, 1995.\\nThe word \"yahoo\" is a backronym for \"Yet Another Hierarchically Organized Oracle\" or \"Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle\". The term \"hierarchical\" described how the Yahoo database was arranged in layers of subcategories. The term \"oracle\" was intended to mean \"source of truth and wisdom\", and the term \"officious\", rather than being related to the word\\'s normal meaning, described the many office workers who would use the Yahoo database while surfing from work. However, Filo and Yang insist they mainly selected the name because they liked the slang definition of a \"yahoo\" (used by college students in David Filo\\'s native Louisiana in the late 1980s and early 1990s to refer to an unsophisticated, rural Southerner): \"rude, unsophisticated, uncouth.\" Filo\\'s college girlfriend often referred to Filo as a \"yahoo.\" This meaning derives from the Yahoo race of fictional beings from Gulliver\\'s Travels.\\n\\n\\n=== Expansion ===\\nYahoo grew rapidly throughout the 1990s. Like many search engines and Web directories, Yahoo added a web portal. By 1998, Yahoo was the most popular starting point for web users. It also made many high-profile acquisitions. Its stock price skyrocketed during the dot-com bubble, Yahoo stocks closing at an all-time high of $118.75 a share on January 3, 2000. However, after the dot-com bubble burst, it reached a post-bubble low of $8.11 on September 26, 2001.\\nIn 2000, Yahoo began using Google for search. Over the next four years, it developed its own search technologies, which it began using in 2004. In response to Google\\'s Gmail, Yahoo began to offer unlimited email storage in 2007. The company struggled through 2008, with several large layoffs.\\nIn February 2008, Microsoft Corporation made an unsolicited bid to acquire Yahoo for US$44.6 billion. Yahoo formally rejected the bid, claiming that it \"substantially undervalues\" the company and was not in the interest of its shareholders. Three years later, Yahoo had a market capitalization of US$22.24 billion. Carol Bartz replaced Yang as CEO in January 2009. In September 2011, she was removed from her position at Yahoo by the company\\'s chairman Roy Bostock, and CFO Tim Morse was named as Interim CEO of the company.\\nIn early 2012, after the appointment of Scott Thompson as CEO, rumors began to spread about looming layoffs. Several key executives, such as Chief Product Officer Blake Irving left. On April 4, 2012, Yahoo announced a cut of 2,000 jobs or about 14 percent of its 14,100 workers. The cut is expected to save around US$375 million annually after the layoffs are completed at end of 2012. In an email sent to employees in April 2012, Thompson reiterated his view that customers should come first at Yahoo. He also completely reorganized the company.\\nOn May 13, 2012, Yahoo issued a press release stating that Thompson was no longer with the company, and would immediately be replaced on an interim basis by Ross Levinsohn, recently appointed head of Yahoo\\'s new Media group. Thompson\\'s total compensation for his 130-day tenure with Yahoo was at least $7.3 million.\\nOn July 16, 2012, Marissa Mayer was appointed President and CEO of Yahoo, effective the following day.\\nOn May 19, 2013 the Yahoo board approved a US$1.1 billion purchase of blogging site Tumblr, and the company\\'s CEO and founder David Karp will remain a large shareholder. The announcement reportedly signifies a changing trend in the technology industry, as large corporations like Yahoo, Facebook, and Google acquire start-up Internet companies that generate low amounts of revenue as a way in which to connect with sizeable, fast-growing online communities. The Wall Street Journal stated that the purchase of Tumblr would satisfy the company\\'s need for \"a thriving social-networking and communications hub.\" On May 20, the company announced the acquisition of Tumblr officially. The company also announced plans to open a San Francisco office in July 2013.\\nOn August 2, 2013, Yahoo Inc. announced the acquisition of social Web browser concern RockMelt. With the acquisition, the RockMelt team, including the concern\\'s CEO Eric Vishria and CTO Tim Howes, will be the part of Yahoo team. As a result, all the RockMelt applications and existing Web services were terminated on August 31.\\nData collated by comScore during July 2013, revealed that more people in the U.S. visited Yahoo Web sites during the month in comparison to Google Web sites; the occasion was the first time that Yahoo outperformed Google since 2011. The data did not incorporate visit statistics for the Yahoo-owned Tumblr site or mobile phone usage.\\n\\n\\n=== Recent developments ===\\nOn March 12, 2014, Yahoo officially announced its partnership with Yelp, Inc., which will help Yahoo boost its local search results to better compete with services like Google.\\nOn November 11, 2014, Yahoo announced it would be acquiring video ad company BrightRoll for $640 million. Video is one of the company\\'s key growth areas and the acquisition will make Yahoo\\'s video ad platform the largest in the U.S.\\nOn November 21, 2014, it was announced that Yahoo had acquired Cooliris.\\nBy the fourth quarter of 2013, the company\\'s share price (NASDAQ: YHOO) had more than doubled since Marissa Mayer took over as president of July 2012; however, the share price peaked at about $35 in November 2013 at $35. It did go up to $36.04 in the mid afternoon of December 2, 2015, perhaps on news that the board of directors was meeting to decide on the future of Mayer, whether to sell the struggling internet business and whether to continue with the spinoff of its stake in China\\'s Alibaba e-commerce site. Not all has gone well during Mayer\\'s tenure including the $1.1 billion acquisition of Tumblr that has yet to prove to be beneficial while the forays into original video content led to a $42 million write-down. Sydney Finkelstein, a professor at Dartmouth College\\'s Tuck School of Business, told the Washington Post that sometimes, \"the single best thing you can do ... is sell the company.\" The closing price of Yahoo! Inc. on December 7, 2015 was $34.68.\\nThe Wall Street Journal\\'s Douglas MacMillan reported that Yahoo\\'s CEO Marissa Mayer is expected to cut 15% of its workforce. The announcement is expected after the market closes on February 2, 2016.\\n\\n\\n== Products and services ==\\n\\nYahoo operates a portal that provides the latest news, entertainment, and sports information. The portal also gives users access to other Yahoo services like Yahoo Mail, Yahoo Maps, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Groups and Yahoo Messenger.\\n\\n\\n=== Storing personal information and tracking usage ===\\nWorking with comScore, The New York Times found that Yahoo was able to collect far more data about users than its competitors from its Web sites and advertising network. By one measure, on average Yahoo had the potential in December 2007 to build a profile of 2,500 records per month about each of its visitors. Yahoo retains search requests for a period of 13 months. However, in response to European regulators, Yahoo obfuscates the IP address of users after three months by deleting its last eight bits.\\nOn March 29, 2012, Yahoo announced that it would introduce a \"Do Not Track\" feature that summer, allowing users to opt out of Web-visit tracking and customized advertisements. However, on April 30, 2014, Yahoo announced that it would no longer support the \"Do Not Track\" browser setting.\\nAccording to a 2008 article in Computerworld, Yahoo has a 2-petabyte, specially built data warehouse that it uses to analyze the behavior of its half-billion Web visitors per month, processing 24 billion daily events. In contrast, the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) database of all United States taxpayers weighs in at only 150 terabytes.\\n\\n\\n=== Communication ===\\nYahoo provides Internet communication services such as Yahoo Messenger and Yahoo Mail. As of May 2007, its e-mail service would offer unlimited storage.\\nYahoo provided social networking services and user-generated content, including products such as My Web, Yahoo Personals, Yahoo 360\\xb0, Delicious, Flickr, and Yahoo Buzz. Yahoo closed Yahoo Buzz, MyBlogLog, and numerous other products on April 21, 2011.\\nYahoo Photos was closed on September 20, 2007, in favor of Flickr. On October 16, 2007, Yahoo announced that it would discontinue Yahoo 360\\xb0, including bug repairs; the company explained that in 2008 it would instead establish a \"universal profile\" similar to the Yahoo Mash experimental system.\\n\\n\\n=== Content ===\\nYahoo partners with numerous content providers in products such as Yahoo Sports, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Music, Yahoo Movies, Yahoo Weather, Yahoo News, Yahoo! Answers and Yahoo Games to provide news and related content. Yahoo provides a personalization service, My Yahoo, which enables users to combine their favorite Yahoo features, content feeds and information onto a single page.\\nOn March 31, 2008, Yahoo launched Shine, a site tailored for women seeking online information and advice between the ages of 25 and 54.\\n\\n\\n=== Co-branded Internet services ===\\n\\nYahoo developed partnerships with broadband providers such as AT&T Inc. (via BellSouth & SBC), Verizon Communications, Rogers Communications, and British Telecom, offering a range of free and premium Yahoo content and services to subscribers.\\n\\n\\n=== Mobile services ===\\nYahoo Mobile offers services for email, instant messaging, and mobile blogging, as well as information services, searches and alerts. Services for the camera phone include entertainment and ring tones.\\nYahoo introduced its Internet search system, called OneSearch, for mobile phones on March 20, 2007. The results include news headlines, images from Flickr, business listings, local weather and links to other sites. Instead of showing only, for example, popular movies or some critical reviews, OneSearch lists local theaters that at the moment are playing the movie, along with user ratings and news headlines regarding the movie. A zip code or city name is required for OneSearch to start delivering local search results.\\nThe results of a Web search are listed on a single page and are prioritized into categories.\\nAs of 2012, Yahoo used Novarra\\'s mobile content transcoding service for OneSearch.\\nOn October 8, 2010, Yahoo announced plans to bring video chat to mobile phones via Yahoo Messenger.\\n\\n\\n=== Commerce ===\\nYahoo offers shopping services such as Yahoo! Shopping, Yahoo Autos, Yahoo Real Estate and Yahoo Travel, which enables users to gather relevant information and make commercial transactions and purchases online. Yahoo Auctions were discontinued in 2007 except for Asia. Yahoo Shopping is a price comparison service which uses the Kelkoo price comparison service it acquired in April 2004.\\n\\n\\n=== Small business ===\\nYahoo provides business services such as Yahoo DomainKeys, Yahoo Web Hosting, Yahoo Merchant Solutions, Yahoo Business Email and Yahoo Store to small business owners and professionals allowing them to build their own online stores using Yahoo\\'s tools.\\n\\n\\n=== Advertising ===\\nYahoo Search Marketing provides services such as Sponsored Search, Local Advertising and Product/Travel/Directory Submit that let different businesses advertise their products and services on the Yahoo network.\\nFollowing the closure of a \"beta\" version on April 30, 2010, the Yahoo Publisher Network was relaunched as an advertising tool that allows online publishers to monetize their websites through the use of site-relevant advertisements.\\nYahoo launched its new Internet advertisement sales system on February 5, 2007, called Panama. It allows advertisers to bid for search terms to trigger their ads on search results pages. The system considers bids, ad quality, clickthrough rates and other factors in ranking ads. Through Panama, Yahoo aims to provide more relevant search results to users, a better overall experience, and to increase monetization.\\nOn April 7, 2008, Yahoo announced APT from Yahoo, which was originally called AMP from Yahoo, an online advertising management platform. The platform simplifies advertising sales by unifying buyer and seller markets. The service was launched in September 2008.\\nIn September 2011, Yahoo formed an ad selling strategic partnership with 2 of its top competitors, AOL and Microsoft. But by 2013 this was found to be underperforming in market share and revenue, as Microsoft simply skimmed off four percent of the search market from Yahoo, without growing their combined share.\\n\\n\\n=== GeoPlanet ===\\n\\nYahoo offers cartographic and geographic services via GeoPlanet.\\n\\n\\n=== Yahoo Next ===\\n\\nYahoo Next is an incubation ground for future Yahoo technologies currently undergoing testing. It contains forums for Yahoo users to give feedback to assist in the development of these future Yahoo technologies.\\n\\n\\n=== Yahoo BOSS ===\\n\\nYahoo Search BOSS is a service that allows developers to build search applications based on Yahoo\\'s search technology. Early Partners in the program include Hakia, Me.dium, Delver, Daylife and Yebol.\\nIn early 2011, the program switched to a paid model using a cost-per-query model from $0.40 to $0.75 CPM (cost per 1000 BOSS queries). The price, as Yahoo explained, depends on whether the query is of web, image, news or other information.\\n\\n\\n=== Yahoo Meme ===\\n\\nYahoo Meme is a beta social service, similar to the popular social networking sites Twitter and Jaiku.\\n\\n\\n=== Y!Connect ===\\nY!Connect enables individuals to leave comments in online publication boards by using their Yahoo ID, instead of having to register with individual publications. The Wall Street Journal reported that Yahoo plans to mimic this strategy used by rival Facebook Inc. to help drive traffic to its site.\\n\\n\\n=== Yahoo Accessibility ===\\nYahoo has invested resources to increase and improve access to the Internet for the disabled community through the Yahoo Accessibility Lab.\\n\\n\\n=== Yahoo Axis ===\\n\\nYahoo Axis is a desktop web browser extension and mobile browser for iOS devices created and developed by Yahoo. The browser made its public debut on May 23, 2012. A copy of the private key used to sign official Yahoo browser extensions for Google Chrome was accidentally leaked in the first public release of the Chrome extension.\\n\\n\\n=== Yahoo SearchMonkey ===\\nYahoo SearchMonkey (often misspelled Search Monkey) was a Yahoo service which allowed developers and site owners to use structured data to make Yahoo Search results more useful and visually appealing, and drive more relevant traffic to their sites. The service was shut down in October 2010 along with other Yahoo services as part of the Microsoft and Yahoo search deal. The name SearchMonkey is an homage to Greasemonkey. Officially the product name has no space and two capital letters.\\nYahoo SearchMonkey was selected as one of the top 10 Semantic Web Products of 2008.\\n\\n\\n=== Defunct services ===\\n\\nGeocities was a popular web hosting service founded in 1995 and was one of the first services to offer web pages to the public. At one point it was the third-most-browsed site on the World Wide Web. Yahoo purchased GeoCities in 1999 and ten years later the web host was closed, deleting some seven million web pages. A great deal of information was lost but many of those sites and pages were mirrored at the Internet Archive, OOcities.com, and other such databases.\\nYahoo Go, a Java-based phone application with access to most of Yahoo services, was closed on January 12, 2010.\\nYahoo 360\\xb0 was a blogging/social networking beta service launched in March 2005 by Yahoo and closed on July 13, 2009. Yahoo Mash beta was another social service closed after one year of operation prior to leaving beta status.\\nYahoo Photos was shut down on September 20, 2007, in favor of integration with Flickr. Yahoo Tech was a website that provided product information and setup advice to users. Yahoo launched the website in May 2006. On March 11, 2010, Yahoo closed down the service and redirected users to Yahoo\\'s technology news section. Other discontinued services include Farechase, My Web, Audio Search, Pets, Live, Kickstart, Briefcase, and Yahoo for Teachers.\\nHotjobs was acquired by and merged with Monster.com.\\nYahoo Koprol was an Indonesian geo-tagging website that allowed users to share information about locations without the use of a GPS device. Koprol was acquired by Yahoo a year following its inception and, in 2011, 1.5 million people were utilizing the website, with users also based in Singapore, the Philippines and Vietnam. However, eighty percent of users were Indonesian. Yahoo officially discontinued Koprol on August 28, 2012, because it did \"not meaningfully drive revenue or engagement\".\\nYahoo Mail Classic was announced as to be shut down in April 2013. Yahoo made a notice that, starting in June 2013, Mail Classic and other old versions of Yahoo Mail will be shut down. All users of Mail Classic are expected to switch to the new Yahoo Mail, use IMAP, or switch to another email service. In addition, April 2013 brought the closure of Upcoming, Yahoo Deals, Yahoo SMS Alerts, Yahoo Kids, Yahoo Mail and Messenger feature phone (J2ME).\\nIn early July 2013 Yahoo announced the scheduled closure of the task management service Astrid. Yahoo had acquired the company in May 2013 and was to discontinue the service on August 5, 2013. The team at Astrid has supplied its customers with a data export tool and recommended former competitors such as Wunderlist and Sandglaz.\\n\\n\\n==== Twitter slide leak on upcoming changes to Yahoo ====\\nOn December 15, 2010, one day after Yahoo announced layoffs of 4% of its workers across their portfolio, MyBlogLog founder Eric Marcoullier posted a slide from a Yahoo employee on Twitter. The slide was visible during an employee-only strategy webcast indicating changes in Yahoo\\'s offerings.\\nThe following services were in a column under \"Sunset\": Yahoo Picks, AltaVista, MyM, AlltheWeb, Yahoo Bookmarks, Yahoo Buzz, del.icio.us, and MyBlogLog. Under the \"Merge\" column were: Upcoming, FoxyTunes, Yahoo Events, Yahoo People Search, Sideline, and FireEagle.\\n11 other properties were listed that Yahoo was interested in developing into feature sites within the portal to take the place of the \"Sunset\" and \"Merge\" vacancies, including the prior feature services (before the new Yahoo Mail was launched), were Yahoo Address Book, Calendar, and Notepad. Despite Notepad being listed as a feature service instead of sunset or merge in 2010, Yahoo has since taken steps to de-emphasize Notepad. For example, in January 2013, Notepad was no longer linked within the new Yahoo mail service, although it continued to be linked in the older Classic version. Also, starting in mid- to late January 2013, Notepad was no longer searchable.\\nThe blog on the del.icio.us website released a post by Chris Yeh after the slide was leaked in which Yeh stated that \"Sunset\" doesn\\'t necessarily mean that Yahoo is closing down the site. Yeh further explained that other possibilities\\u2014including del.icio.us leaving Yahoo (through sale or spinoff)\\u2014were still being considered: \"We can only imagine how upsetting the news coverage over the past 24 hours has been to many of you. Speaking for our team, we were very disappointed by the way that this appeared in the press.\" On April 27, 2011, Yahoo\\'s sale of del.icio.us to Avos was announced.\\nYahoo Buzz was closed down on April 21, 2011 without an official announcement from Yahoo. MyBlogLog was then discontinued by Yahoo on May 24, 2011.\\n\\n\\n== Privacy ==\\n\\nIn September 2013 The Indian Express reported that Yahoo received 29 thousand requests for information about users from governments in the first six months of 2013. Over 12 thousand of the requests came from the United States.\\nIn October 2013, The Washington Post reported that the U.S. National Security Agency intercepted communications between Yahoo\\'s data centers, as part of a program named MUSCULAR.\\nIn late January 2014, Yahoo announced on its company blog that it had detected a \"coordinated effort\" to hack into possibly millions of Yahoo Mail accounts. The company prompted users to reset their passwords, but did not elaborate on the scope of the possible breach, citing an ongoing federal investigation.\\n\\n\\n== Criticism ==\\n\\nIn 2000, Yahoo was taken to court in France by parties seeking to prevent French citizens from purchasing memorabilia relating to the Nazi Party. In March 2004, Yahoo launched a paid inclusion program whereby commercial websites were guaranteed listings on the Yahoo search engine. Yahoo discontinued the program at the end of 2009. Yahoo was criticized for providing ads via the Yahoo ad network to companies who display them through spyware and adware.\\nYahoo, as well as other search engines, cooperated with the Chinese government in censoring search results. In April 2005, dissident Shi Tao was sentenced to 10 years in prison for \"providing state secrets to foreign entities\" as a result of being identified by IP address by Yahoo. Human rights organizations and the company\\'s general counsel disputed the extent of Yahoo\\'s foreknowledge of Shi\\'s fate. Human rights groups also accuse Yahoo of aiding authorities in the arrest of dissidents Li Zhi and Jiang Lijun.\\nIn September 2003, dissident Wang Xiaoning was convicted of charges of \"incitement to subvert state power\" and was sentenced to ten years in prison. Yahoo Hong Kong connected Wang\\'s group to a specific Yahoo e-mail address. Both Xiaoning\\'s wife and the World Organization for Human Rights sued Yahoo under human rights laws on behalf of Wang and Shi.\\nAs a result of media scrutiny relating to Internet child predators and a lack of significant ad revenues, Yahoo\\'s \"user created\" chatrooms were closed down in June 2005. On May 25, 2006, Yahoo\\'s image search was criticized for bringing up sexually explicit images even when SafeSearch was active. Yahoo was a 40% (24% in September 2013) owner of Alibaba Group, which was a subject of controversy for allowing the sale of shark-derived products. The company banned the sale of shark fin products on all its e-commerce platforms effective January 1, 2009. On November 30, 2009, Yahoo was criticized by the Electronic Frontier Foundation for sending a DMCA notice to whistle-blower website \"Cryptome\" for publicly posting details, prices, and procedures on obtaining private information pertaining to Yahoo\\'s subscribers.\\nAfter some concerns over censorship of private emails regarding a website affiliated with Occupy Wall Street protests were raised, Yahoo responded with an apology and explained it as an accident.\\n\\n\\n== Management ==\\n\\n\\n=== Board of Directors ===\\nDavid Filo (2014) Co-Founder, Chief Yahoo and Director, Yahoo Inc.!\\nSue James (2010) Retired Partner, Ernst & Young LLP\\nMax Levchin (2012) Chairman and CEO, HVF, LLC\\nMarissa Mayer (2012) \\u2013 CEO, Yahoo!

Shaw (2014) Retired Chairman of the Board Intel Corporation\\nMaynard Webb (2012) \\u2013 Chairman, Yahoo, founder, Webb Investment Network and chairman and former CEO of LiveOps\\n\\n\\n=== Chief Executive Officers ===\\nMarissa Mayer (2012\\u2013)\\nRoss Levinsohn Interim (2012)\\nScott Thompson (2012)\\nTim Morse Interim (2011\\u20132012)\\nCarol Bartz (2009\\u20132011)\\nJerry Yang (2007\\u20132009)\\nTerry Semel (2001\\u20132007)\\nTimothy Koogle (1995\\u20132001)\\nFormer chief operating officer Henrique de Castro departed from the company in January 2014 after Mayer, who initially hired him after her appointment as CEO, dismissed him. de Castro, who previously worked for Google and McKinsey & Company, was employed to revive Yahoo\\u2019s advertising business.\\n\\n\\n== Yahoo International ==\\n\\nYahoo offers a multi-lingual interface. The site is available in over 20 languages. The official directory for all of the Yahoo International sites is world.yahoo.com. The company\\'s international sites are wholly owned by Yahoo, with the exception of its Japan and China sites.\\nYahoo holds a 34.75% minority stake in Yahoo Japan, while SoftBank holds 35.45%, YahooXtra in New Zealand, which Yahoo!7 have 51% of and 49% belongs to Telecom New Zealand, and Yahoo!7 in Australia, which is a 50\\u201350 agreement between Yahoo and the Seven Network. Historically, Yahoo entered into joint venture agreements with SoftBank for the major European sites (UK, France and Germany) and well as South Korea and Japan. In November 2005, Yahoo purchased the minority interests that SoftBank owned in Europe and Korea.\\nYahoo used to hold a 40% stake in Alibaba, which manages a web portal in China using the Yahoo brand name. Yahoo in the USA does not have direct control over Alibaba, which operates as a completely independent company. On September 18, 2012, following years of negotiations, Yahoo agreed to sell a 20% stake back to Alibaba for $7.6 billion.\\nOn March 8, 2011 Yahoo launched its Romania local service after years of delay due to the financial crisis.\\nYahoo officially entered the MENA region when it acquired Maktoob, a pan-regional, Arabic-language hosting and social services online portal, on August 25, 2009. Since the service is pan-regional, Yahoo officially became Yahoo Maktoob in the region.\\nOn December 31, 2012, Yahoo Korea shut down all its services and left the country, with its previous domain saying in Korean, \"Starting from December 31, 2012, Yahoo! Korea has ended. You can go to the original Yahoo! for more Yahoo\\'s information.\" Sooner did that message also disappear, leaving with just an abandoned, empty search bar powered by Bing.\\nOn September 2, 2013, Yahoo China shut down and is being redirected to taobao.com.\\n\\n\\n== Logos and themes ==\\n\\nThe first logo appeared when the company was founded in 1994\\u2014it was red with three icons on each side. The logo used on the Yahoo home page formerly consisted of the color red with a black outline and shadow; however, in May 2009, together with a theme redesign, the logo was changed to purple without an outline or shadow. This change also applied to several international Yahoo home pages. In some countries, most notably Yahoo!7 (of Australia), the logo remained red until 2014. On occasion the logo is abbreviated: \"Y!\".\\nOn August 7, 2013, at around midnight EDT, Yahoo announced that the final version of the new logo would be revealed on September 5, 2013 at 4:00 a.m. UTC. In the period leading up to the unveiling of the new logo, the \"30 Days of Change\" campaign was introduced, whereby a variation of the logo was published every day for the 30 days following the announcement. The new logo was eventually launched with an accompanying video that showed its digital construction, and Mayer published a personalized description of the design process on her Tumblr page. Mayer explains:\\n\\nSo, one weekend this summer, I rolled up my sleeves and dove into the trenches with our logo design team ... We spent the majority of Saturday and Sunday designing the logo from start to finish, and we had a ton of fun weighing every minute detail. We knew we wanted a logo that reflected Yahoo - whimsical, yet sophisticated. Modern and fresh, with a nod to our history. Having a human touch, personal. Proud.\\n\\nOn September 19, 2013, Yahoo launched a new version of the \"My Yahoo\" personalized homepage. The redesign allows users to tailor a homepage with widgets that access features such as email accounts, calendars, Flickr and other Yahoo content, and Internet content. Users can also select \"theme packs\" that represent artists such as Polly Apfelbaum and Alec Monopoly, and bands such as Empire of the Sun. Mayer then explained at a conference in late September 2013 that the logo change was the result of feedback from both external parties and employees.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nOfficial website\\nYahoo transparency reports\\n\\nYahoo! at DMOZ'"
